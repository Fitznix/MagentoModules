# MagentoModules
Magento modules are two modules I created that were added to a magento site.
Anonymouse allerts will send an email alert to a customer that is not logged into magento when a product comes back in stock.
The update module transfers data from a database that is outside of the magento build and creates budled products. It also keeps the products up to date with the database
