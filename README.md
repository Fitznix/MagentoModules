# MagentoModules
Magento modules are two modules I created that were added to a magento site.
Anonymous alerts will send an email alert to a customer that is not logged into magento when a product comes back into stock.
The update module, transfers data from a database that is outside of the magento build and creates bundled products. It also keeps the products up to date with the database
